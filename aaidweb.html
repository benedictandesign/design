He lived a life worthy of kings; food was served to his nose, we had to bathe him, he lived rent-free. He was a dog living without worries. In fact, that was probably how dogs enjoyed their life.</p>
          <p class = "popup-para">Fast forward 40 years later. We have replaced these animals as the new dogs of society. What a time to be alive! I say we should be grateful for the opportunities this period of human civilisation has. No longer do we have to worry about our survival as an individual or species.
            What we can pursue then is the finer things in life; the experience of enjoyment. Life afterall has an expiry. Why suffer when we can live in contentment? If you know whats good for you, live as a dog!</p>

Conducted in JAMUS Tower B's Intelligence Lab, the experiement lasted 10 years with approximately 10 million people involved. Data collected in this experiment was done through the monitoring of human behaviours online.</p>
          <p class = "popup-para">Those who use the internet more than 60 hours per week tend to show signs of improved cognition ability and are able to handle more complex tasks. "This is good news because that means that what we have set up here is working for us humans" Thomas Keffer, head of UX/UI of JAMUS Internet.
          Generally, JAMUS UI/UX recommends that users spend time on the internet for at least 65 hours for tangible improvements to be seen. JAMUS also noted that those who perform poorly tend to be the post-amish regions of the city. Nevertheless, the experiment paves way for more infrastructure to be set up in these areas to provide regular access for the citizens.</p>

          <br>
          <p class = "popup-para">The rise of hacking culture here seems to correlate with the increased access to the dark web. There was a 35% increase of users accessing these sites from the past year. More often than not, the sites cloak themselves in the guise of advertisements and lure unsuspecting users of the internet into the sites.</p>
          <p class = "popup-para">"The dark web has always been a fertile ground to for hacking activities to be conducted. Users who unknowingly enter might be radicalised by the ideas existing there and become dangerous individuals for society." Reknowed internet anthropologist Kimmy Hudson reminded us in view of the recent hack attack by the radical left group Renew which left large parts
             of the city disfunctional in the morning of January 4 2058. "These groups advocate for the overthrowing of the current economic system which is existing for 4 decades and has saved the world from a global environmental disaster. Do we want to revert back to the disasterous environmental conditions that our predecessors suffered under?"</p>
