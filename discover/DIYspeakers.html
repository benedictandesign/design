    <div class="sstyle1"><h2>The Story</h2></div>

    <div class="sstyle2"><p>Often when I'm engaged in a conversation regarding DIY electronic products, computer builds seems to be the most common topic. Yet I have never heard of anyone designing their very own custom speakers. That was until a few months ago when my friend popped up this topic to me. At that point in time, I was stunned. Both computer and speaker components can be found in the same electronic malls such as Sim Lim Square/Tower. However,  I had never considered the possibility of designing my own set of speakers even though I owned a custom computer. Cognizant of the fact that I did not own any speakers in my 22 years living in a technological society, I took it upon myself to create one. </p></div>

    <div class="sstyle2"><p>There are numerous types of speakers that one can build; from a single full range driver set-up to a surround sound system, the possibilities are endless. In my case, since I bought from Carousell a used set of 2 woofers and 2 tweeters stripped from an Infiniti car for a cheap $20, I decided to build a 2.0 system (A pair of stereo speakers each receiving left and right audio inputs respectively.)</p></div>

    <div class="sstyle2"><p>Now that the system type has been decided, on to sourcing for the other parts that I need for this project. On the electronics side of things, what I needed to obtain was a pair of audio cables and an electrical circuit system. After days of sourcing for these parts, these were what I had decided to buy.</p></div>

<div class="sstyle1"><h2>Parts Considerations</h2></div>

<div class="sstyle2"><h4>1) Audio Cable:</h4></div>

<div class="sstyle2">
  <ul>
    <div><li>Copper Cable. A length of 5m is more than sufficient for my usage considering that my speakers will not be more than a meter apart from the amplifier.</li></div>
    <div><li>Banana Plug. A type of connector commonly used for audio equipment. It provides a convenient way to link the cable and the speakers together.</li></div>
    <div><li>Heat Shrink. A tube that permanently shrinks when heat is applied. Used to secure the cable and banana plug together.</li></div>
    <div><li>Banana Plug Terminals. Helps to connect the banana plug to the speaker circuit.</li></div>
    <div><li>Wire Sleeves. Wraps around the cable to conceal its raw appearance. Purely to give the cables a more premium look and texture.</li></div>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="sstyle2"><p>I have attached a video below to give you an idea of how the components should be assembled together.</p></div>

<div class="sstyle2"><h4>2) Electrical Circuit System.</h4></div>

<ul class="">
  <div class="sstyle2"><li>Crossover: Now here's where the more exciting part of building comes into play. Since each of my speakers is made up of a woofer and tweeter, I would require a crossover circuit. The purpose of this circuit is to channel the higher frequency inputs to the tweeter and the lower frequency spectrum to the woofer. The frequency at which the destination of the input switches (Either to the woofer or tweeter) is known as the crossover frequency and this can be altered to optimize the strengths of each specialized speaker.
  Crossovers are essentially RLC circuits and the parts needed to make one can easily be found in electronic malls. However, since I was not confident towards creating one given the physics I learned, I chose to buy a ready made one instead.</li></div>

  <div class="sstyle2"><p>When shopping for a crossover, do take note of the following 3 specifications:</p></div>

  <ul>
    <div class="sstyle2"><li>Crossover Frequency:</li></div>
    <div class="sstyle2"><li>Do check the range of frequencies at which your speaker drivers perform well. In my case, I was unable to find the specifications of my drivers online, hence I took the safer route and opted for a crossover at 3.2kHz, which is relatively common for setups similar to mine.</li></div>
    <div class="sstyle2"><li>Power rating:</li></div>
    <div class="sstyle2"><li>Supplying too much power into the crossover can damage it. Make sure that the amplifier that is used to power the speaker is suitable for the crossover.</li></div>
    <div class="sstyle2"><li>Impedance rating:</li></div>
    <div class="sstyle2"><li>The overall impedance of the speakers should not be beyond the stated range given by the crossover lest you risk damage.</li></div>
  </ul>

  <div class="sstyle2"><p>Arranging my tweeter (8 ohms) and woofer (4 ohms) in parallel gave an impedance score of about 2.67 ohms. Unfortunately, I bought my crossover that works well in the range of 4 - 8 ohms. Cross my fingers and hope all goes well later on!</p></div>

  <div class="sstyle2"><li>Amplifier: Again without any clue regarding the power rating of my speakers, I took the safer route of getting an amplifier rated 20W which stays within range of most speakers and my crossovers' power rating.</li></div>
</ul>

<div class="sstyle1"><h2>Assembly</h2></div>
<div class="sstyle2"><p>This is a relatively straightforward process of assembling the parts together either by soldering or through connectors/terminals.</p></div>

<div class="storyimg"><img src="../gallery/Speaker_Circuit_Diagram.jpg">
  <div>Overall circuit diagram of how all the different parts are assembled together.</div>
</div>

<div class="sstyle1"><h2>Result</h2></div>

<div class="sstyle2"><p>Not bad at all! My speakers performed nicely during my first attempt. There was no noticeable change in audio quality during the transition from woofer to tweeter. The only issue that I encountered was a high pitch distortion at frequencies below 100Hz which I have no issues with since my music mainly resides in the higher frequencies.</p></div>

<div class="sstyle1"><h2>What's Next?</h2></div>

<div class="sstyle2"><p>Now that the electronics are all working fine. The next step is to fabricate the case for my bookshelf speaker. I'm currently exploring the feasibility of a concrete case shaped using a 3D printed mold. This method is proving to be trickier than I had expected mainly due to 3 reasons.</p></div>
<h4 class="sstyle2">1) Texture:</h4>
<ul class="sstyle2">Typical 3D printers print layer by layer starting from the bottom to the top, resulting in a jagged texture finishing. Smoothening the surface through filing or sandpaper is possible although it can be a tedious process especially in convex shapes.</ul>
<h4 class="sstyle2">2) Porous:</h4>
<ul class="sstyle2">Water is an essential ingredient in the formation of concrete. If the 3D printed mold is porous, this will disrupt the chemical taking place and the concrete will crumble easily.</ul>
<h4 class="sstyle2">3) Time: </h4>
<ul class="sstyle2">A mold of this size is likely to take more than 20 hours of printing time. Since I am only allowed to book the printer for about 3 hours a day, I'll have to think more carefully about how I can speed up the printing process. No doubt I would have to print sections of the mold at a time.</ul>

<div class="sstyle1"><h2>Concept</h2></div>

<div class="sstyle2"><p>Since this is my first experience towards speaker building, I wanted my speaker casing to fulfill my following criterias:</p></div>
<h4 class="sstyle2">1) Easily Unassembled:</h4>
<ul class="sstyle2">Should there be any issues with the circuit, I want to be able to troubleshoot the internals easily. I do not want a situation where the casing has to be damaged just to access the electronics.</ul>
<h4 class="sstyle2">2) Small Footprint:</h4>
<ul class="sstyle2">The ideal speaker would be one which does not take up too much desk space so that the space can also be used for other purposes.</ul>
<h4 class="sstyle2">3) Aesthetically Pleasing:</h4>
<ul class="sstyle2">A normal rectangular boxed casing actually fulfills the above 2 criterias and may even be aesthethic given the right material choices. However, I wanted to challenge myself to see what shapes can be fabricated given the constraints that I'm facing.</ul>

<div class="sstyle2"><p>With the 3 needs that I stated and the limitations of a 3D printer, this is a rough concept of the case that I'm intending to build for the moment. It's very likely however that I'm going to change to a more regular shape that is easier to fabricate.</p></div>

  <div style="float: right;text-align:center;width:100%;padding-bottom:15px;">Ideal plan for the case design.</div>
</div>

<div class="sstyle2"><p>Hope that this can be completed in the coming weeks so that I can show it to all of you. I'll be uploading my progress in this page so be sure to check it out from time to time. Cheers!</p></div>
